# AI Engineer Learning - Summary (Lessons 1 to 6)

## Lesson 1 - GitHub Automation
- Learned to use **PyGithub** for automating commits to a GitHub repository.
- Steps included:
  1. Creating a personal access token.
  2. Setting up `.env` file for secure token storage.
  3. Using Python script to read, modify, and commit files automatically.

## Lesson 2 - Basic Python Classes & Operators
- Built a custom `Matrix` class with:
  - Initialization from 2D lists.
  - Matrix multiplication via `__mul__` operator overloading.
  - Validation for multiplication dimension compatibility.

## Lesson 3 - GitHub Integration with Automation
- Automatically committed new Python solution files to GitHub after solving problems.
- Used Python script to commit with a message format like `Added Lesson X solution`.

## Lesson 4 - Problem Solving Practice
- Started solving algorithmic challenges.
- Uploaded solved code directly to GitHub using automation.
- Examples: matrix operations, small coding puzzles.

## Lesson 5 - Data Analysis Basics
- Learned **Pandas** basics:
  - Loading CSV files.
  - Viewing data statistics (`describe()`).
  - Filtering data by conditions.

## Lesson 6 - Data Preprocessing for AI
- Implemented a `DataLoader` class for:
  1. Filling missing values (mean for numeric, "Unknown" for categorical).
  2. Encoding categorical values to numeric using a dictionary mapping.
  3. Normalizing numeric columns to **0–1** range.
- Practiced handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling data — all essential preprocessing steps before training machine learning models.

## Skills Covered So Far
- **GitHub automation** (PyGithub).
- **Python OOP** (classes, special methods, operator overloading).
- **Pandas data manipulation**.
- **Data preprocessing for ML** (fillna, encoding, normalization).
- **Version control workflow** with automated commits.
